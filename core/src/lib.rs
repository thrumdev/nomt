//! Core operations and types within the Nearly Optimal Merkle Trie.
//!
//! This crate defines the schema and basic operations over the merkle trie in a backend-agnostic manner.
//! 
//! Nothing within this crate relies on the standard library.
//!
//! ## Schema
//!
//! This crate defines a binary merkle trie, generalized over a 256 bit hash function. All keys have 256 bits.
//!
//! There are two kinds of  nodes: [`Internal`] nodes, which each have two children, 
//! and [`Leaf`] nodes which store value hashes.
//! The trie itself does not store values. Sub-tries which contain no values are referenced with 
//! the placeholder [`EMPTY_SUBTREE`] hash. All nodes can be encoded as 512 bit values.
//!
//! Node hashes are domain-separated: the most significant bit is reserved
//! as an indication of the type of node. A node hash with an MSB of 0 refers to an internal node, 
//! and a node hash with an MSB of 1 refers to a leaf node.
