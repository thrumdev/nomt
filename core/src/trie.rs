//! This module defines the types of a binary merkle trie, generalized over a 256 bit hash function.
//! All lookup paths in the trie are 256 bits.
//!
//! All nodes are 256 bits. There are three kinds of nodes.
//!   1. Internal nodes, which each have two children. The value of an internal node is
//!       given by hashing the concatenation of the two child nodes and setting the MSB to 0.
//!   2. Leaf nodes, which have zero children. The value of a leaf node is given by hashing
//!       the concatenation of the 256-bit lookup path and the hash of the value stored at the leaf,
//!       and setting the MSB to 1.
//!   3. [`TERMINATOR`] nodes, which have the special value of all 0s. These nodes have no children
//!      and serve as a stand-in for an empty sub-trie at any height. Terminator nodes enable the
//!      trie to be tractably represented.
//!
//! All node preimages are 512 bits.
