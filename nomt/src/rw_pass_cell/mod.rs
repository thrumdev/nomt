//! A data structure similar to a `RwLock`, but with a twist: it can only be accessed when the
//! correct pass is shown. This is useful when you want to obtain a read or write lock on some
//! subset of data, that is not necessarily owned by a single object.
//!
//! The usage pattern is as follows:
//!
//! 1. Create a [`RwPassDomain`] with [`RwPassDomain::new()`].
//! 2. Protect the data you want to access with a [`RwPassCell`] by calling
//!    [`RwPassDomain::protect()`].
//! 3. Obtain a read or write pass by calling [`RwPassDomain::new_read_pass()`] or
//!    [`RwPassDomain::new_write_pass()`].
//! 4. Use the pass to access the data within any of [`RwPassCell`]-s created within the domain
//!    using the [`RwPassCell::read()`] or [`RwPassCell::write()`] methods.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # use nomt::rw_pass_cell::{RwPassDomain, RwPassCell, ReadPass, WritePass};
//!
//! let domain = RwPassDomain::new();
//! let cell: RwPassCell<usize> = domain.protect(42);
//! let read_pass = domain.new_read_pass();
//! assert_eq!(cell.read(&read_pass).get(), 42);
//! ```
