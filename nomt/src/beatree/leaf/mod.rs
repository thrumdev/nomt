// The `LeafStore` struct manages leaves. It's responsible for management (allocation and
// deallocation) and querying the LNs by their LNID.
//
// It maintains an in-memory copy of the freelist to facilitate the page management. The allocation
// is performed in LIFO order. The allocations are performed in batches to amortize the IO for the
// freelist and metadata updates (growing the file in case freelist is empty).
//
// The leaf store doesn't perform caching. When querying the leaf store returns a handle to a page.
// As soon as the handle is dropped, the data becomes inaccessible and another disk roundtrip would
// be required to access the data again.
